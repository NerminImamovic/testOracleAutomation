<b>Abstract</b>

The train represents a complex system, where every sub-system has an important role. If a subsystem
doesn’t work how it should, the correctness of whole the train can be uncertain. To ensure
that system works properly, we should test each sub-system individually and integrate them together
in the whole system. Each of these subsystems consists of the different modules with different
functionalities what should be tested.

Testing of different functionalities often requires a different approach. For some functionalities,
it is necessary domain knowledge from the human expert, such as classification of signals in different
use cases in Propulsion and Controls (PPC) in Bombardier Transportation. Due to this reason,
we need to simulate of using experts knowledge in the certain domain. We are investigating the use
of machine learning techniques for solving this cases and creating system what will automatically
classify different signals using the previous human knowledge.

This case study is conducted in Bombardier Transportation (BT), V¨aster˚as in departments
Train Control Management System (TCMS) and Propulsion and Controls (PPC), where data is
collected, analyzed and evaluated. We proposed a method for solving the oracle problem based on
machine learning approach for different for certain use case. Also, we explained different steps
what can be used for solving the test oracle problem where signals are part of verdict process.
